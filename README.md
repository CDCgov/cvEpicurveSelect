## Overview
The purpose of this package is to help find a set of areas that look like the epidemic pattern of a target area — for example, when choosing comparison areas to evaluate an intervention or when designing a sentinel surveillance network. Under the hood, it does this efficiently by combining potential control areas in a weighted way that best matches the target area, using a stepwise cross-validation approach. 

Potential use-cases include the following:

* Identify control areas as counterfactuals for evaluating the impact of area-level interventions (e.g. select a group of counties that can best serve as a control for a county implementing a vector-control strategy to estimate the effect).
* Select surveillance areas representative of epidemic patterns of target surveillance area (ex. select a set of hospitals or clinics as sentinel surveillance areas that best represent a state's epidemic patterns).

For additional details, please see the package vignette.
